# Weather-App
A weather app built with ReactJS is designed to work smoothly on any device. It fetches real-time weather data from a service like OpenWeatherMap and updates it using Reactâ€™s features. The app can find your location automatically or let you enter it manually. It displays the weather with clear icons, graphs, and maps for easy understanding.
